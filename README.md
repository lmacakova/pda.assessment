## About Project:
This is my project for the module Principles of Data Analytics. It is my analysis of Palmer Penguins Dataset

### Palmers Penguins Dataset Package
The Palmers Penguins dataset package contains data about 344 penguins of genus [*Pygoscelis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygoscelis), containing 3 species: [Adelie penguin](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/adepen1/cur/introduction)(*Pygoscelis adeliae*), [Chinstrap penguin](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/chipen2/cur/introduction) (*Pygoscelis antarcticus*), [Gentoo penguin](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/genpen1/cur/introduction) (*Pygoscelis papua*). Field research was conducted during the austral summers of 2007/08, 2008/09, and 2009/10 on Biscoe, Torgersen, and Dream islands of Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica[^1]. Palmers Penguins dataset package contains 2 datasets: penguins and penguins_raw. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). Data are available by [CC-0 license](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) following the [Palmer Station LTER Data Policy](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/data/) and the [LTER Data Access Policy for Type I data](https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/) [^2].

### About Penguins Dataset: 
The dataset contains data in 7 columns: species, island, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, flipper length in mm, body mass in g, and sex. This dataset is the simplified version of penguins_raw.

### Targets of this project:
- Source, clean, and investigate the dataset. 
- Explore and visualize data in the dataset.
- Apply mathematical data analysis techniques to find possible relationships between data.

### How users can get started with the project:
With README.md and then follow the steps in penguins.ipynb.
